## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I've just starting coding. I try my best to use semantically correct HTML elements. I learned "small" element from one of youtube videos, I'm happy that I remembered to use it for copyright. Though I read that "footer" element would be enough for copyright, so maybe I'm overdoing while trying to use semantic code. I haven't learned CSS Flexbox or Grid yet, so it was such a hussle trying to center the card. Now I understand center the div jokes.

```html
<footer>

</footer>
```
```css
body {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```


### Continued development

I want to fix the footer element to the bottom, I think I can manage it after learning flexbox & grid.
